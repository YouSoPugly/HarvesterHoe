Harvester Hoe plugin for 1.8.8 Spigot. 

Ignore the awful class structure, it started extremely basic but then I kept adding to it. I'll probably restructure soon.

So far, has a working upgrade and drop system & fully customizable config.

Still missing is the menu to actually upgrade the hoe, and a currency manager & data storage to give upgrade currency.
